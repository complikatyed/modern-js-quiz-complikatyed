// Robot Planning (with Matthew Russell's help)

// Attributes:  attack, defense, speed, stamina
// Offensive Technology (raises attack abilities): lasers, missiles, blades
// Defensive Technology: forcefield (increases defense/blocks attack), smoke shield (slows other robots), sonar (detects attack)
// Speed Technology: jet pack, turbo booster, supersonic blast
// Stamina/Strength Technology:  the juicer, lightning bolt, iron man
// When attack points increase, defense points are lowered
// When defense increases, speed lowers
// When speed increases, stamina lowers
// When stamina increases, attack lowers

// WHEN DEFENSIVE POINTS = 0, opponent's attack points increase by 10
// WHEN ATTACK POINTS = 0, player loses
// WHEN SPEED POINTS = 0, attack points decrease by 5
// WHEN STAMINA POINTS = 0, player loses
